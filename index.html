<p>My name is Shavita Eichelberger. I made this website to share one of my favorite place, Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of my favorite places to visit, and I even have it tattooed on my hand. I've always wanted to go to Paris and see it in person. I'm planning to visit for my birthday in January, which makes this project even more special. It gave me a chance to learn more about the city and why it's such a popular vacation spot. </p>
